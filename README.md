# Face-Generation-Using-DCGANs

Run the First Section of any of the Notebook to download and extract the Celebrity Dataset in the current working directory

                                                OR

Download and extract the dataset manually from this link and put the files in this structure

Run all the cells of the notebook to train on 100,000 batches of images

## Best Results From Each Notebook

Each Batch Contains 64 randomly selected images from the dataset

### Best Results from the Shallow Network
